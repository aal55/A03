## What Are "GIT" and "GITHUB?"
*Git* is a popular version control software that allows programmers to share and work on programs. On the other hand, *GitHub* is simply a website that serves as a medium for Git, allowing people to access and utilize the software.

## The Ins and Outs of Repositories
On GitHub, projects come in the form of *repositories*, which store any file that is essential to the project in mind. If you would want a local copy of a repository, you would have to *clone* it, which would copy the existing repository to your computer. Whenever you want to save changes made to a repository, you would have to make a *commit*. When you make a commit, a *push* (basically a send) occurs, which updates your repository (on GitHub in this case) with the new changes. After your commit is made, you can authorize a *pull* request, which would allow others to peer review your code against their pre-existing version and *merge* it with their main *branch*. On the subject of merging and branches, when you create a repository on GitHub, a master branch is created, which can be viewed as a big clump of Play-Doh. When you make another branch, you're taking a copy of your master branch (like an identical jar of Play-Doh) and changing it at your own whim. Afterwards, when play-time is over and you've added some stuff to your other branch, you can merge that branch back to your master branch just like clumping Play-Doh together. However, when merging, there is a good chance you will come across *merge conflicts* which are essentially caused by differences in lines of code between the branches that are merging. To make sure your pull request comes through, you would have to make sure to resolve each merge conflict. A *fetch* is quite similar to a pull, but the biggest difference separating the two is that you do not have to merge when fetching. Lastly, a *remote* is just a location where team members working on a project can store their code, with an example being a GitHub repository.
